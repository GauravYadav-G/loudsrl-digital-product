      title: 'What Is Digital Marketing?',
      subtitle: 'The comprehensive process of leveraging search, paid media, social, and web technologies',
      desc: 'Digital marketing is the process of using online channels—search engines, paid advertising, social media platforms, email, and websites—to promote and sell products or services. At ARKA Technovation Private Limited, we utilize our extensive engineering experience and world-class technical knowledge to help businesses reach their full online potential, building cohesive growth engines that drive sustainable revenue.',

        'Multi-channel synergy: Coordinating search, paid advertising, social media, and video for maximum impact',

    {
      q: 'How long does it take to see tangible results from an enterprise SEO campaign?',
      a: 'While technical fixes and Core Web Vitals optimizations yield measurable speed and indexing improvements within 2 to 4 weeks, significant organic keyword movements and inbound lead volume typically compound between months 3 and 6 as domain authority and content clusters mature.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What makes Competitor and Addressable Geofencing different from standard radius targeting?',
      a: 'Standard radius targeting casts a wide net around an entire city or postal code. Competitor Geofencing draws razor-sharp virtual boundaries down to 1,000 square feet around specific competitor buildings or convention halls. Addressable Geofencing takes a street-level list of client addresses and matches mobile advertising IDs to deliver ads directly to those exact households.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does ARKA Technovation Private Limited handle Google Guaranteed and Local Services Ads?',
      a: 'We guide your company through the entire Google Guaranteed verification process, including background checks, license verification, and insurance compliance. Once approved, your business displays the green Google Guaranteed badge at the very top of local search results, and you only pay for valid phone inquiries.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Does ARKA Technovation Private Limited outsource any SEO, paid media, or content development?',
      a: 'No. Every technical audit, schema implementation, keyword strategy, and copywriting piece is executed by our full-time, in-house team located at our Corporate Headquarters in Sector 63, Noida. We believe in 100% direct accountability.',
