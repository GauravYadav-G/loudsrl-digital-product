This unified model ensures unbroken accountability, deep technical rigor, and seamless cross-disciplinary execution.',

      q: 'What is the typical turnaround time for corporate film and video production?',
      a: 'Depending on the scale and complexity, a high-impact corporate film or product demo video typically takes 3 to 5 weeks from initial script sign-off through location shooting, editing, DaVinci color grading, sound design, and final broadcast delivery. Rapid social video cut-downs and event coverage can be delivered in as little as 48 to 72 hours.',
